This is an Ergonomic PSeudo SPlit 75-key Keyboard. It was desinged after two years of working with a [Truly Ergonomic CLEAVE Keyboard](https://trulyergonomic.com) and is also inspired by the [Redox Keyboard](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard).
The layout I am using and shown in the image is the [NOTED](https://github.com/dariogoetz/noted-layout) layout.

In addition to the firmware created by QMK, I am using the [ReNeo](https://neo-layout.org/Einrichtung/reneo/) software which offers more possible key functions and in total six layers.
