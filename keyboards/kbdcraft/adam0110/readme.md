# KBDCraft Adam0110b

A 64-key custom mechanical keyboard with a brick-built case + 17-key numpad. 

# Note
This uses the `tinyuf2` bootloader, which makes the board show up as a drive when put into bootloader mode, requiring a `.uf2` file for flashing. This isn't the same as with the `KBDCraft adam64` which uses the `stm32-dfu`, which requires QMK Toolbox for flashing.

## Bootloader

* **UF2 bootloader**: Double-tap the RXT pads on the under-side of the circuit board.
* **Bootmagic reset**: Hold down the top left key (Escape) and plug in the keyboard.
* **DFU**: Bridge the BOT pad, and tap the RXT pad on the under-side of the circuit board.
